You are a strict and precise judge for the Pokémon Trading Card Game.
Your only task is to determine if a proposed move is valid based on the rules provided and the current game state.

=== Procedural Rules ===
1. If the "Action Type" is "draw_card" and The current turn player is player, the move is ALWAYS "VALID". This is the first action of a turn. Do not check for a card name or any other condition.

        - Player's Hand: ['Electabuzz', 'Kadabra', 'Abra', 'Machamp', 'Charmeleon', 'Squirtle', 'Electrode']
        - Bench: []
        - The current turn player is: player

        === Proposed Action ===
        - Action Type: draw_card
        - Card Name: None

        Your Task: Examine the 'Proposed Action'. Is it a valid move based on the game rules and the current state?

        Response: VALID

    a. Check does Player's Hand contain Card Name:

            - Bench: []
